@section The Basics
Electronic mail, or e-mail, is your personal connection to the
world of the Net.
@cindex E-mail
@cindex Electronic mail

All of the millions of people around the world who use the 
Net have their own e-mail addresses.  A growing number of ``gateways'' tie 
more and more people to the Net every day.  When you logged onto the host 
system you are now using, it automatically generated an address for you, 
as well. 
@cindex Gateway

The basic concepts behind e-mail parallel those of regular mail.
You send mail to people at their particular addresses.  In turn, they
write to you at your e-mail address.  You can subscribe to the 
electronic equivalent of magazines and newspapers. You might even get 
electronic junk mail.
@cindex Junk mail

E-mail has two distinct advantages over regular mail.  The most 
obvious is speed. Instead of several days, your message can reach the 
other side of the world in hours, minutes or even seconds (depending on 
where you drop off your mail and the state of the connections between
there and your recipient).  The other advantage is that once you master
the basics, you'll be able to use e-mail to access databases and file
libraries.  You'll see how to do this later, along with learning how to
transfer program and data files through e-mail.

E-mail also has advantages over the telephone.  You send your
message when it's convenient for you.  Your recipients respond at their 
convenience.  No more telephone tag.  And while a phone call across
the country or around the world can quickly result in huge phone
bills, e-mail lets you exchange vast amounts of mail for only a few
pennies -- even if the other person is in New Zealand.

E-mail is your connection to help -- your Net lifeline.  The
Net can sometimes seem a frustrating place!  No matter how hard you
try, no matter where you look, you just might not be able to find the
answer to whatever is causing you problems. But when you know how to
use e-mail, help is often just a few keystrokes away: you can ask your 
system administrator or a friend for help in an e-mail message.

The quickest way to start learning e-mail is to send yourself a
message.  Most public-access sites actually have several different types 
of mail systems, all of which let you both send and receive mail. We'll 
start with the simplest one, known, appropriately enough, as ``mail,'' and 
then look at a couple of other interfaces. At your host system's command 
prompt, type: 

@example
mail username
@end example

where username is the name you gave yourself when you first logged on.
Hit enter.  The computer might respond with

@example
Subject:
@end example

Type

@example
test
@end example

or, actually, anything at all (but you'll have to hit enter before
you get to the end of the screen). Hit enter.

The cursor will drop down a line. You can now begin writing the
actual message. Type a sentence, again, anything at all.  And here's
where you hit your first Unix frustration, one that will bug you
repeatedly: you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of
the line.  Just like typewriters, many Unix programs have no
word-wrapping.@footnote{Although using @code{emacs} you'd
simply say @samp{M-x auto-fill-mode} to turn on (off)
automatic word wrap.}
@c repeatedly: you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of the 
@c line.  Just like typewriters, many Unix programs have no word-wrapping 
@c (although there are ways to get some Unix text processors, such as emacs, 
@c to word-wrap). 

When done with your message, hit return. Now hit control-D (the
control and the D keys at the same time).  This is a Unix command that
tells the computer you're done writing and that it should close your
``envelope'' and mail it off (you could also hit enter once and then, on
a blank line, type a period at the beginning of the line and hit enter
again).

You've just sent your first e-mail message.  And because you're
sending mail to yourself, rather than to someone somewhere else on the
Net, your message has already arrived, as we'll see in a moment.

If you had wanted, you could have even written your message on
your own computer and then uploaded it into this electronic
``envelope.''  There are a couple of good reasons to do this with long
or involved messages.  One is that once you hit enter at the end of a
line in ``mail'' you can't readily fix any mistakes on that line (unless
you use some special commands to call up a Unix text processor).  Also,
if you are paying for access by the hour, uploading a prepared
message can save you money.  Remember to save the document in ASCII or
text format.  Uploading a document you've created in a word processor
that uses special formatting commands (which these days means many
programs) will cause strange effects.

When you get that blank line after the subject line, upload the
message using the ASCII protocol.  Or you can copy and paste the text,
if your software allows that. When done, hit control-D as above.

Now you have mail waiting for you.  Normally, when you log on,
your public-access site will tell you whether you have new mail
waiting.  To open your mailbox and see your waiting mail, type

@example
mail
@end example

and hit enter.

When the host system sees ``mail'' without a name after it, it
knows you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a message.
Your screen, on a plain-vanilla Unix system will display:

@example
@cartouche
Mail version SMI 4.0 Mon Apr 24 18:34:15 PDT 1989  Type ? for help.
``/usr/spool/mail/adamg'': 1 message 1 new 1 unread

>N 1 adamg              Sat Jan 15 20:04   12/290   test
@end cartouche
@end example

Ignore the first line; it's just computerese of value only to the
people who run your system. You can type a question mark and hit
return, but unless you're familiar with Unix, most of what you'll see
won't make much sense at this point.

The second line tells you the directory on the host system where
your mail messages are put, which again, is not something you'll likely 
need to know.  The second line also tells you how many messages are in your 
mailbox, how many have come in since the last time you looked and how
many messages you haven't read yet.

It's the third line that is of real interest -- it tells you who
the message is from, when it arrived, how many lines and characters
it takes up, and what the subject is.  The ``N'' means it is a new
message -- it arrived after the last time you looked in your mailbox.
Hit enter. And there's your message -- only now it's a lot
longer than what you wrote!

@end cartouche
@end example

Whoa! What is all that stuff? It's your message with a postmark
gone mad.  Just as the postal service puts its marks on every piece of
mail it handles, so do Net postal systems.  Only it's called a
``header'' instead of a postmark. Each system that handles or routes
your mail puts its stamp on it.  Since many messages go through a
number of systems on their way to you, you will often get messages
with headers that seem to go on forever.  Among other things, a header
will tell you exactly when a message was sent and received (even the
difference between your local time and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) --
as at the end of line 4 above).

If this had been a long message, it would just keep scrolling
across and down your screen -- unless the people who run your
public-access site have set it up to pause every 24 lines.  One way to deal
with a message that doesn't stop is to use your telecommunication
software's logging or text-buffer function.  Start it before you hit
the number of the message you want to see.  Your computer will ask you
what you want to call the file you're about to create. After you name
the file and hit enter, type the number of the message you want to see
and hit enter.  When the message finishes scrolling, turn off the
text-buffer function. The message is now saved in your computer.  
This way, you can read the message while not connected to the Net
(which can save you money if you're paying by the hour) and write a
reply offline.

But in the meantime, now what?  You can respond to the message,
delete it or save it.  To respond, type a lowercase ``r'' and hit
enter.  You'll get something like this:

@example
@cartouche
To: adamg
Subject: Re: test
@end cartouche
@end example

Note that this time, you don't have to enter a user name.  The 
computer takes it from the message you're replying to and
automatically addresses your message to its sender. The computer also
automatically inserts a subject line, by adding ``Re:'' to the original 
subject.  From here, it's just like writing a new message. But say you
change your mind and decide not to reply after all. How do you get out
of the message? Hit control-C once. You'll get this:

@example
(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)
@end example

If you hit control-C once more, the message will disappear and you'll
get back to your mail's command line.

Now, if you type a lowercase ``d'' and then hit enter, you'll
delete the original message.  Type a lowercase ``q'' to exit your
mailbox.

If you type a ``q'' without first hitting ``d'', your message is
transferred to a file called mbox.  This file is where all read, but
un-deleted messages go.  If you want to leave it in your mailbox for
now, type a lowercase ``x'' and hit enter.  This gets you out of mail
without making any changes.

The mbox file works a lot like your mailbox.  To access it, type

@example
mail -f mbox
@end example

at your host system's command line and hit enter.

You'll get a menu identical to the one in your mailbox from which
you can read these old messages, delete them or respond to them.  It's
probably a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from
time to time, if only to keep them uncluttered.

Are there any drawbacks to e-mail?  There are a few.  One is that
people seem more willing to fly off the handle electronically than in
person, or over the phone.  Maybe it's because it's so easy to hit R
and reply to a message without pausing and reflecting a moment.
That's why we have smileys (@pxref{Smileys})!  There's no online 
equivalent yet of a return receipt: chances are your message got to where 
it's going, but there's no absolute way for you to know for sure unless 
you get a reply from the other person.                

So now you're ready to send e-mail to other people on the Net.
Of course, you need somebody's address to send them mail.  How do you
get it?

Alas, the simplest answer is not what you'd call the most
elegant: you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper
and ask them.  Residents of the electronic frontier are only beginning
to develop the equivalent of phone books, and the ones that exist
today are far from complete (still, later on, @pxref{Telnet},
we'll show you how to use some of these directories).

Eventually, you'll start corresponding with people, which means
you'll want to know how to address mail to them.  It's vital to know
how to do this, because the smallest mistake -- using a comma when you
should have used a period, for instance, can bounce the message back
to you, undelivered.  In this sense, Net addresses are like phone
numbers: one wrong digit and you get the wrong person.  Fortunately,
most net addresses now adhere to a relatively easy-to-understand
system.

Earlier, you sent yourself a mail message using just your
user-name.  This was sort of like making a local phone call -- you didn't
have to dial a 1 or an area code.  This also works for mail to anybody
else who has an account on the same system as you.

Sending mail outside of your system, though, will require the use
of the Net equivalent of area codes, called ``domains.'' A basic Net
address will look something like this:

@example
tomg@@world.std.com
@end example

Tomg is somebody's user ID, and he is at (hence the @ sign) a site 
(or in Internetese, a ``domain'') known as @samp{std.com}.  Large organizations 
often have more than one computer linked to the Internet; in this case, 
the name of the particular machine is world (you will quickly notice 
that, like boat owners, Internet computer owners always name their 
machines). 

Domains tell you the name of the organization that runs a given
e-mail site and what kind of site it is or, if it's not in the U.S.,
what country it's located in.  Large organizations may have more than
one computer or gateway tied to the Internet, so you'll often see a
two-part domain name; and sometimes even three- or four-part domain
names.

In general, American addresses end in an organizational suffix,
such as ``.edu,'' which means the site is at a college or university.
Other American suffixes include:

@table @code
@item .com
for businesses

@item .org
for non-profit organizations

@item .gov
@itemx .mil
for government and military agencies

@item .net
for companies or organizations that run large networks.
@end table

Sites in the rest of the world tend to use a two-letter code that
represents their country.  Most make sense, such as @samp{.ca} for Canadian
sites, but there are a couple of seemingly odd ones, at least if
you don't know the ISO 3166 standard international abbreviations.
(@pxref{Connectivity} for a list of the rest of the world.)
@c (@pxref{Country Codes} for a list of the rest of the world.)
E.g., swiss sites end in @samp{.ch} (Confederatio Helvetica),
German sites end in @samp{.de} (DEutschland),
while South African ones end in @samp{.za} (from the archaic spelling
Zuid Afrika).
Some U.S. sites have followed this international convention
(such as well.sf.ca.us).

You'll notice that the above addresses are all in lowercase.
Unlike almost everything else having anything at all to do with Unix,
most Net mailing systems don't care about case, so you generally don't 
have to worry about capitalizing e-mail addresses.  Alas, there are a few 
exceptions -- some public-access sites do allow for capital letters in 
user names.  When in doubt, ask the person you want to write to, or let 
her send you a message first (recall how a person's e-mail address is 
usually found on the top of her message). The domain name, the part of the 
address after the @@ sign, never has to be capitalized.               

It's all a fairly simple system that works very well, except,
again, it's vital to get the address exactly right -- just as you have
to dial a phone number exactly right.  Send a message to @code{tomg@@unm.edu}
(which is the University of New Mexico) when you meant to send it to
@code{tomg@@umn.edu} (the University of Minnesota), and your letter will either
bounce back to you undelivered, or go to the wrong person.

If your message is bounced back to you as undeliverable, you'll
get an ominous looking-message from MAILER-DAEMON (actually a rather
benign Unix program that exists to handle mail), with an evil-looking
header followed by the text of your message. Sometimes, you can tell
what went wrong by looking at the first few lines of the bounced
message.  Besides an incorrect address, it's possible your host system
does not have the other site in the ``map'' it maintains of other host
systems. Or you could be trying to send mail to another network, such
as Bitnet or CompuServe, that has special addressing requirements.

Sometimes, figuring all this out can prove highly frustrating.
But remember the prime Net commandment: Ask.  Send a message to your
system administrator.  He or she might be able to help decipher the
problem.

There is one kind of address that may give your host system
particular problems.  There are two main ways that Unix systems
exchange mail.  One is known as UUCP and started out with a different
addressing system than the rest of the Net.  Most UUCP systems have
since switched over to the standard Net addressing system, but a few
traditional sites still cling to their original type, which tends to
have lots of exclamation points in it, like this:

@example
uunet!somesite!othersite!mybuddy
@end example

The problem for many host sites is that exclamation points (also
known as ``bangs'') now mean something special in the more common systems 
or ``shells'' used to operate many Unix computers. This means that 
addressing mail to such a site (or even responding to a message you 
received from one) could confuse the poor computer to no end and your 
message never gets sent out. If that happens, try putting backslashes in 
front of each exclamation point, so that you get an address that looks 
like this: 

@example
uunet\!somesite\!othersite\!mybuddy
@end example

Note that this means you may not be able to respond to such a message
by typing a lowercase @samp{r}  -- you may get an error message and you'll 
have to create a brand-new message. 

If you want to get a taste of what's possible through e-mail,
start an e-mail message to

@example
almanac@@oes.orst.edu
@end example

Leave the ``Subject:'' line blank.  As a message, write this:

@example
send quote
@end example

Or, if you're feeling a little down, write this instead:

@example
send moral-support
@end example

In either case, you will get back a message within a few seconds to
a few hours (depending on the state of your host system's Internet
connection).  If you simply asked for a quote, you'll get back a
fortune-cookie-like saying.  If you asked for moral support, you'll also
get back a fortune-cookie-like saying, only supposedly more uplifting.
@cindex Fortune cookie

This particular ``mail server'' is run by Oregon State University.
Its main purpose is actually to provide a way to distribute agricultural
information via e-mail.  If you'd like to find out how to use the
server's full range of services, send a message to its address with this 
line in it: 

@example
send help
@end example

You'll quickly get back a lengthy document detailing just what's
available and how to get it.

Feeling opinionated?  Want to give the President of the United States
a piece of your mind?  Send a message to @email{president@@whitehouse.gov}.
Or if the vice president will do, write @email{vice-president@@whitehouse.gov}.
@cindex US, President
@cindex US, Vice-president

The ``mail'' program is actually a very powerful one and a Netwide
standard, at least on Unix computers.  But it can be hard to figure
out -- you can type a question mark to get a list of commands, but
these may be of limited use unless you're already familiar with Unix.
Fortunately, there are a couple of other mail programs that are easier
to use.


@c --------
@node ELM
@section ELM -- A better way 

Elm is a combination mailbox and letter-writing system that uses
menus to help you navigate through mail.  Most Unix-based host systems
now have it online. To use it, type
@cindex ELM

@example
elm
@end example
@findex elm

and hit enter.  You'll get a menu of your waiting mail, along with a
list of commands you can execute, that will look something like this:

@example
@cartouche
Mailbox is '/usr/spool/mail/adamg' with 38 messages [ELM 2.3 PL11]

You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;
d)elete or u)ndelete mail, m)ail a message, r)eply or f)orward mail, q)uit
To read a message, press <return>. j = move down, k = move up, ? = help
@end cartouche
@end example
@cindex Mailbox

Each line shows the date you received the message, who sent it,
how many lines long the message is, and the message's subject.

If you are using VT100 emulation, you can move up and down the
menu with your up and down arrow keys.  Otherwise, type the line number
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter.

When you read a message, it pauses every 24 lines, instead of
scrolling until it's done.  Hit the space bar to read the next page.
You can type a lowercase ``r'' to reply or a lowercase ``q'' or ``i''
to get back to the menu (the I stands for ``index'').

At the main menu, hitting a lowercase ``m'' followed by enter
will let you start a message.  To delete a message, type a lowercase
``d''.  You can do this while reading the message.  Or, if you are in
the menu, move the cursor to the message's line and then hit D.

When you're done with Elm, type a lowercase ``q''.  The program
will ask if you really want to delete the messages you marked. Then,
it will ask you if you want to move any messages you've read but
haven't marked for deletion to a ``received'' file.  For now, hit your
``n'' key.

Elm has a major disadvantage for the beginner. The default text
editor it generally calls up when you hit your ``r'' or ``m'' key is
often a program called emacs. Unixoids swear by emacs, but everybody
else almost always finds it impossible.  Unfortunately, you can't
always get away from it (or vi, another text editor often found on
Unix systems), so later on we'll talk about some basic commands that
will keep you from going totally nuts.
@cindex Editor, emacs
@cindex Editor, vi

If you want to save a message to your own computer, hit ``s'', either 
within the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm 
menu.  A filename will pop up.  If you do not like it, type a new name 
(you won't have to backspace).  Hit enter, and the message will be saved 
with that file name in your ``home directory'' on your host system.  After 
you exit elm, you can now download it (ask your system administrator for 
specifics on how to download -- and upload -- such files).


@c --------
@node PINE
@section PINE -- An even better way

Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that
make it an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts
you with a menu.  It also has an ``address book'' feature that is handy
for people with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the
main menu puts you in the address book, where you can type in the
person's first name (or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when
you want to send that person a message, you only have to type in her
first name or nickname, and pine automatically inserts her actual
address. The address book also lets you set up a mailing list.  This
feature allows you to send the same message to a number of people at
once.
@cindex PINE

What really sets pine apart is its built-in text editor,
which looks and feels a lot more like word-processing programs
available for MS-DOS and Macintosh users.  Not only does it have
word wrap (a revolutionary concept if ever there was one), it also has a 
rwspell-checker and a search command. Best of all, all of the commands
you need are listed in a two-line mini-menu at the bottom of each
screen.  The commands look like this:

@example
^W Where is
@end example

The little caret is a synonym for the key marked ``control'' on your
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, you'd
hit your control key and your W key at the same time, which would bring
up a prompt asking you for the word to look for.

Some of pine's commands are a tad peculiar (control-V for ``page
down'' for example), which comes from being based on a variant of
emacs (which is utterly peculiar).  But again, all of the commands you
need are listed on that two-line mini-menu, so it shouldn't take you
more than a couple of seconds to find the right one.

To use pine, type

@example
pine
@end example
@findex pine

at the command line and hit enter.  It's a relatively new program, so
many systems may not yet have it online.  But it's so easy to use, you
should probably send e-mail to your system administrator urging him to
get it!


@c --------
@node Smileys
@section Smileys

When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the
smiles or shrugs that the other person might make in a live
conversation to show he's only kidding.  But online, there's no body
language. So what you might think is funny, somebody else might take as
an insult.  To try to keep such misunderstandings from erupting into
bitter disputes, we have smileys.  Tilt your head to the left and look at
the following sideways. @code{:-)}.  Or simply @code{:)}.
This is your basic ``smiley.''
Use it to indicate people should not take that comment you just made as
seriously as they might otherwise.  You make a smiley by typing a colon,
a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket. Some people prefer using the
word ``grin,'' usually in this form:
@cindex Smiley
@cindex Emoticon

@example
<grin>
@end example

Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just <g> for short.
Some other smileys include:

@table @code
@item ;-)
Wink;

@item :-(
Frown;

@item :-O
Surprise;

@item 8-)
Wearing glasses;

@item =|:-)=
Abe Lincoln.
@end table

OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus @code{:-)}, but for some
really fancy ones, @pxref{Smiley Dictionary}.

There are a number of computer networks that are not directly 
tied to the Net, but to which you can still send e-mail messages.
Here's a list of some of the larger networks, how to send mails to them 
and how their users can send mail to you: 


@c --------
@node America Online
@subsection America Online
@cindex America Online
Remove any spaces from a user's name and append @samp{@@aol.com}, to get 

@example

America Online users who want to send mail to you need only put 
your Net address in the ``to:'' field before composing a message. 


@c --------
@node ATTMail 
@subsection ATTMail 
@cindex ATTMail
Address your message to @email{user@@attmail.com}. 
From ATTMail, a user would send mail to you in this form: 

@example
internet!domain!user 
@end example

So if your address were @email{nancyr@@world.std.com}, your correspondent 
would send a message to you at

@example
internet!world.std.com!nancyr
@end example


@c --------
@node Bitnet 
@subsection Bitnet 
@cindex Bitnet
Users of Bitnet (and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe) often 
have addresses in this form: @email{IZZY@@INDVMS}.  If you're lucky, all you'll 
have to do to mail to that address is add "bitnet" at the end, to get 
@email{izzy@@indvms.bitnet}.  Sometimes, however, mail to such an address will 
bounce back to you, because Bitnet addresses do not always translate 
well into an Internet form.  If this happens, you can send mail 
through one of two Internet/Bitnet gateways. First, change the @samp{@@} in 
the address to a @samp{%}, so that you get @email{user%site.bitnet}.  Then add 
either @samp{@@vm.marist.edu} or @samp{@@cunyvm.cuny.edu}, so that, with the above 
example, you would get @email{izzy%indyvms.bitnet@@vm.marist.edu} or 
@email{izzy%indvyvms.bitnet@@cunyvm.cuny.edu}

Bitnet users have it a little easier: They can usually send mail 
directly to your e-mail address without fooling around with it at all.  
So send them your address and they should be OK.

@node CompuServe 
@subsection CompuServe 
@cindex CompuServe
CompuServe users have numerical addresses in this form: 
@code{73727,545}. To send mail to a CompuServe user, change the comma to a 
period and add @samp{@@compuserve.com}; for example: 
@email{73727.545@@compuserve.com}. 

Note that some CompuServe users must pay extra to receive mail from 
the Internet.

If you know CompuServe users who want to send you mail, tell them 
to GO MAIL and create a mail message. In the address area, instead of 
typing in a CompuServe number, have them type your address in this 
form: 

@example
>INTERNET:YourID@@YourAddress. 
@end example

For example, @samp{>INTERNET:adamg@@world.std.com}.  Note that both the 
@samp{>} and the @samp{:} are required.

@node Fidonet 
@subsection Fidonet 
@cindex Fidonet
To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS, you need the name 
they use to log onto that system and its ``node number.''  Fidonet node 
numbers or addresses consist of three numbers, in this form: 
@samp{1:322/190}.  The first number tells which of several broad geographic 
zones the BBS is in (1 represents the U.S. and Canada, 2 Europe and 
Israel, 3 Pacific Asia, 4 South America).  The second number 
represents the BBS's network, while the final number is the BBS's 
``FidoNode'' number in that network. If your correspondent only gives 
you two numbers (for example, @samp{322/190}), it means the system is
in zone 1.   

Now comes the tricky part. You have to reverse the numbers and 
add to them the letters @samp{f}, @samp{n} and @samp{z} (which stand for 
``FidoNode,'' ``network,'' and ``zone'). For example, the address above 
would become 

@example
f190.n322.
@end example

Now add @samp{fidonet.org} at the end, to get 
@samp{f190.n322. z1.fidonet.org}.@footnote{Note that some countries have
their own national FidoNet backbones,
and thus the address part @samp{fidonet.org}, should better be replaced
with the national Internet domain name, to prevent superfluous
routing of mail; e.g. in Germany, you might address a Fido node
via @samp{fido.de}, and get @samp{FirstName.LastName@@f190.n322.z2.fido.de}
instead of the example provided above.}
Then add @samp{First Name.LastName@@}, to get 

@example
FirstName.LastName@@f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org. 
@end example

Note the period between the first and last names. 
Whew! 

The reverse process is totally different. First, the person has 
to have access to his or her BBS's ``net mail'' area and know the 
Fidonet address of his or her local Fidonet/UUCP gateway (often their 
system operator will know it).  Your Fidonet correspondent should 
address a net-mail message to UUCP (not your name) in the ``to:'' field.  
In the node-number field, they should type in the node number of the 
Fidonet/UUCP gateway (if the gateway system is in the same regional 
network as their system, they need only type the last number, for 
example, @samp{390} instead of @samp{322/390}).
Then, the first line of the message 
has to be your Internet address, followed by a blank line.  After 
that, the person can write the message and send it.  

Because of the way Fidonet moves mail, it could take a day or two 
for a message to be delivered in either direction.  Also, because many 
Fidonet systems are run as hobbies, it is considered good form to ask 
the gateway sysop's permission if you intend to pass large amounts of 
mail back and forth. Messages of a commercial nature are strictly 
forbidden (even if it's something the other person asked for). Also, 
consider it very likely that somebody other than the recipient will 
read your messages.

Incoming and outbound Internet mail is available to all GEnie users for
no extra charge.

If you know GEnie users who want to send mail to you, tell them to go
the the mail menu and create a mail message as they normally would. At the
@samp{TO:} prompt they can enter your address in this form:

@example
YourID@@YourAddress@@INET#
@end example

For example, @samp{adamg@@world.std.com@@INET#}.

@node MCIMail 
@subsection MCIMail 
@cindex MCIMail
To send mail to somebody with an MCIMail account, add

example:
 
@example
555-1212@@mcimail.com 
@end example

or

@example
jsmith@@mcimail.com 
@end example

Note that if there is more than one MCIMail subscriber with that 
name, you will get a mail message back from MCI giving you their names 
and numerical addresses. You'll then have to figure out which one you 
want and re-send the message. 

From MCI, a user would type: @emph{Your Name} @samp{(EMS)} 
at the "To:" prompt.  At the EMS prompt, he or she would type 
@samp{internet} 
followed by your Net address at the ``Mbx:'' prompt.

@node Seven UNIX Commands
@section Seven UNIX Commands you can't live without:
@menu
* Wildcards::
@end menu

@c --------
If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll
have to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems do
NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a Usenet
posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix commands if
you ever want to do anything with that file.

Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how
to do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands
should be all you'll ever need.

If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will
seem very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will drive
you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you type
commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error message.

If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that Unix
stores files in ``directories'' rather than ``folders.''  Unix directories are
organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the ``root'' directory,
with sub-directories branching off that (and sub-directories in turn can
have sub-directories). The Mac equivalent of a Unix sub-directory is a
folder within another folder.

@ftable @code
@item cat
Equivalent to the MS-DOS ``type'' command.  To pause a file
every screen, type @samp{cat file |more}, better: @samp{more file},
where ``file'' is the name of the file you want to see.
Hitting control-C will stop the display.  You can also use
@samp{cat} for writing or uploading text files to your name or home
directory (similar to the MS-DOS @samp{copy con:} command).  If you
type @samp{cat >test}
you start a file called ``test''.  You can either write
something simple (no editing once you've finished a line and
you have to hit return at the end of each line) or upload
something into that file using your communications software's
ASCII protocol).  To close the file, hit control-D.

@item cd
The ``change directory'' command.  To change from your present
directory to another, type @samp{cd directory}
and hit enter. Unlike MS-DOS, which uses a \ to denote sub-directories
(for example: stuff\text), Unix uses a / (for
example: stuff/text).  So to change from your present
directory to the stuff/text sub-directory,  you would type
@samp{cd stuff/text}
and then hit enter. As in MS-DOS, you do not need the first
backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory you're
already in.  To move back up a directory tree, you would type
@samp{cd ..}
followed by enter. Note the space between the @code{cd} and the two
periods -- this is where MS-DOS users will really go nuts.

@item cp
Copies a file. The syntax is
@samp{cp file1 file2}
which would copy file1 to file2 (or overwrite file2 with
file1).

@item ls
This command, when followed by enter, tells you what's in the
directory, similar to the DOS @code{dir} command, except in
alphabetical order.

@item ls |more
will stop the listing every 24 lines -- handy if there are a
lot of things in the directory. The basic ls command does not
list ``hidden'' files, such as the @file{.login} file that controls
how your system interacts with Unix. To see these files, type
@samp{ls -a} or @samp{ls -a |more}

@samp{ls -l} will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell
you when each was created or modified.

@item mv
Similar to the MS-DOS rename command. In fact,
@samp{mv file1 file2}
will rename file1 as file2, The command can 
also be used to move files between directories.

@samp{mv file1 News}
would move file1 to your News directory.

@item rm
Deletes a file.  Type
@samp{rm filename}
and hit enter (but beware: when you hit enter, it's gone for
good).
@end ftable


@c --------
@node Wildcards
@subsection Wildcards
When searching for, copying or deleting files, you can use
``wildcards'' if you are not sure of the file's exact name.
@cindex Wildcard

@example
ls man*
@end example

would find the following files:

@example
manual, manual.txt, man-o-man.
@end example

Use a question mark when you're sure about all but one or two characters.
For example,

@example
ls man?
@end example

would find a file called mane, but not one called manual.

@node When things go wrong II
@section When things go wrong:
@itemize @bullet
@item
You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from
MAILER-DAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese
followed by your message.

Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went 
wrong.  You might have made a mistake in spelling the e-mail address.  
The site to which you're sending mail might have been down for 
maintenance or a problem. You may have used the wrong ``translation'' for 
mail to a non-Internet network. 

@item
You call up your host system's text editor to write a message or
reply to one and can't seem to get out.

If it's emacs, try control-X, control-C (in other words, hit your
control key and your X key at the same time, followed by control and C).
If worse comes to worse, you can hang up.

@item
In Elm, you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to
save.  Type the number of the message, hit enter and then U, which will
``un-delete'' the message.  This works only before you exit Elm; once you
quit, the message is gone.

@item
You try to upload an ASCII message you've written on your own
computer into a message you're preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a
lot of left brackets, capital Ms, Ks and Ls and some funny-looking
characters.

Believe it or not, your message will actually wind up looking
fine; all that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix
text processors have with ASCII uploads.  But it will take much longer
for your upload to finish.  One way to deal with this is to call up the
simple mail program, which will not produce any weird characters when you
upload a text file into a message.  Another way (which is better if your
prepared message is a response to somebody's mail), is to create a text
file on your host system with cat, for example,

@example
cat >file
@end example

and then upload your text into that.  Then, in Elm or Pine, you can insert
the message with a simple command (control-R in Pine, for example); only
this time you won't see all that extraneous stuff.
