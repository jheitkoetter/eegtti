	* SO, WHATZ THE PROBLEM? (with apologies to Douglas Adams)

   There are of course many problems connected with young ape-descended life
forms, of which some of the most popular are `What is life all about?'
`Will I ever be able really to understand young ape-descended life forms
of the oppopsite sex?' And `What is the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet?'

   The Encyclopedia Galactica defines the "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet"
as a mostly interesting attempt by the EFF to bring knowledge to the people.
The marketing division of Sirius Cybernectics Corporation defines the "Big
Dummy's Guide to the Internet" as `Your Electronic Online Pal Who's Fun To
Be With.'  The Texinfo editor of "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet" (aka
"bdgtti.texi") defines it as `The Best Stuff I've Been Involved In Since
Breakfast.'

   Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that had the
good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future
defined the "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet" as a mostly interesting but
useless attempt by the EFF to bring knowledge to the people...?
