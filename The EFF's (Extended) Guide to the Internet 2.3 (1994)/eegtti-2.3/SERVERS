   This file lists the currently (September 1994) officially available
electronic archive sites/services, that either distribute "EFF's (Extended)
Guide to the Internet", or let you browse through it using the latest of
infosystems technologies...

Please note that the Texinfo based version (below addressed as "The Guide")
is different from the original HyperCard and ASCII files, (cf the README
for more info on this issue).

			-=- * -=-

		* THE WHOLE STORY COMPRESSED

   The Guide comes in a variety of formats: PostScript (.ps), TeX DVI (.dvi),
GNU Info (.info), plain text (.txt), HyperText Markup Language (.html), 
AmigaGuide (.amiga) and the complete source distribution (including some
patch files, you'll need to use Makeinfo-1.55, and texi2html-1.30) bundled
in a Tarfile (.tar).

Depending on the system adminstrator, ie. the disk space he's willing to give
away for The Guide, these files will be stored in one of some dozen of
compression "flavors". Thus, here's an excerpt from the FTP chapter of
The Guide, that explains the whole story:

FTP (Mining the Net, part II)
*****************************
[..]
   There are a wide variety of compression methods in use.  You can tell
which method was used by the last one to three letters at the end of a file.
Here are some of the more common ones and what you'll need to un-compress the
files they create (and these decompression programs can all be located
through archie).

`.txt'
`.TXT'
     By itself, this means the file is a document, rather than a program.

`.ps'
`.PS'
     A PostScript document (in Adobe's page description language).  You can
     print this file on any PostScript capable printer, or use a previewer,
     like GNU project's GhostScript.

`.doc'
`.DOC'
     Is another common suffix for documents. No de-compression is needed,
     unless it is followed by

`.z'
     A file compressed by the Unix `pack' utility.  It uses Huffman coding
     (which minimizes redundancy) on each byte.  Type `unpack filename.z' or
     `gunzip filename.z' to decompress it.  This suffix was also briefly used
     to indicate gzip'ed files before `.gz' was adopted.  However, some sites
     *still* use this suffix for gzip'ed files, e.g.  the EFF's FTP-server,
     due to local set-ups.

`.Z'
     This is a Unix compression method.  To uncompress the file, type
     `uncompress filename.Z' or `gunzip filename.z' and hit enter at your
     host system's command prompt. If it's a text file, you can read it
     online by typing `zcat file.txt.Z |more' at your host system's command
     line. There is a Macintosh program called "MacCompress" that you can use
     on your machine if you want to download the file (use archie to find
     where you can get it!). There's an MS-DOS equivalent, often found as
     `u16.ZIP', which means it is itself compressed in the ZIP format.

`.zip'
`.ZIP'
     An MS-DOS format. Use the PKZIP package (usually found as `PKZ201.exe'
     or something similar).

`.gz'
     The GNU project's compression format. A variant of the PKZIP format. Use
     `gunzip filename.gz' to uncompress.

`.zoo'
`.ZOO'
     A Unix and MS-DOS format. Requires the use of a program called zoo.

`.Hqx'
`.hqx'
     A Macintosh format that needs BinHex for de-coding.

`.shar'
`.Shar'
     A Unix format. Use unshar.

`.tar'
     Another Unix format, often used to glue several related files and/or
     completet directory trees into one big file.  Use the `tar' command.
     Often, a "tarred" file will also be compressed with the `.Z' method, so
     you first have to use uncompress and then tar.

`.TGZ'
`.TAZ'
     Sometimes used for compressed tar archives `.tar.Z', that are stored on
     "3 letter suffix only systems" (aka MS-DOS).

`.sit'
`.Sit'
     A Macintosh format, requires StuffIt.

`.ARC'
     A DOS format that requires the use of ARC or ARCE.

`.LZH'
     Another DOS compression format; requires the use of LHARC.

`.lz'
`.lha'
     The Amiga variant of LHARC. It's the most common Amiga archiving method,
     and made with the program `lha' or `lz'.

		* THE WHOLE LIST OF FILES

   Check the version number! Get 2.3, it's the latest! Some servers may
run "out of pace" with updates; so check out more than one of the SERVERS
listed below. The default distribution (all papers sizes) is placed on
"ftp.Germany.EU.net", in "pub/books/eff-guide/"

                 |-README                  // FAQ file
                 |-README.VMS              // help for VMS folks
|-extended-guide-|-eegtti-2.3.ps.gz        // PostScript
                 |-eegtti-2.3.dvi.gz       // TeX DVI file
                 |-eegtti-2.3-US.dvi.gz    // TeX DVI US paper
                 |-eegtti-2.3-US.ps.gz     // TeX PS US paper
                 |-eegtti-2.3.info.gz      // GNU Info file
                 |-eegtti-2.3.txt.gz       // TEXT file
                 |-eegtti-2.3.html.tar.gz  // HTML (WWW) files
                 |-eegtti-2.3.amiga.lha    // AmigaGuide files
                 |-eegtti-2.3.tar.gz       // all Texinfo sources

In the US, it's avail. from "ftp.EFF.ORG", in "/pub/Net_info/EFF_Net_Guide/"
(or whatever is the current path...)

		* E-MAIL SERVERS (FTPmail & Squirrel)

  In order o get the (unextended) ASCII version just send (any) e-mail
  to netguide@eff.org. It will be sent back automatically split into
  several pieces. Otherwise, you can retrieve *any* version this way:

EUROPE
  Address: <archive-server@germany.eu.net> (Squirrel)

  Message layout:
    BEGIN
    REPLY <your-own-e-mail-address-here>
    SEND <file-name1>
    SEND <file-name2>
    ...
    END

  Sample:
    To: archive-server@germany.eu.net
    Subject:

    BEGIN
    REPLY dummy@neverland.com
    SEND books/eff-guide/README
    SEND books/eff-guide/extended-guide/eegtti-2.3.ps
    END


NORTH AMERICA
  Address: <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com> (FTPmail)

  Message layout:
    reply <your-own-e-mail-address-here>
    connect <any-FTP-server-you-want>
    get <file-name1>
    get <file-name2>
    ...
    quit

 Sample:
    To: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
    Subject:

    reply joke@foo.bar
    connect ftp.eff.org
    get /pub/Net_info/EFF_Net_Guide/Other_versions/eegtti-2.3.ps
    quit

 And then?
    You'll receive a mail from <nobody@pa.dec.com> with a contents similar
    to the following:

      We processed the following input from your mail message:

	reply joke@foo.bar
	connect ftp.eff.org
        get /pub/Net_info/EFF_Net_Guide/Other_versions/eegtti-2.3.ps
	quit

      We have entered the following request into our job queue
      as job number 749212187.29067:

	connect ftp.germany.eu.net anonymous -ftpmail/joke@foo.bar
	reply joke@foo.bar
	get pub/Net_Info/EFF_Net_Guide/Other_versions/eegtti-2.3.ps

      There are 876 jobs ahead of this one in our queue.

      You should expect the results to be mailed to you within a day or so.
      [..]

NOTICE
    * If you don't know how to uncompress gzip'ed files (.gz), or any
    other howevercompressed files, just don't tell FTPmail the suffix!
    FTPmail is clever enough to *automatically* uncompress the file(s)
    split them, and mail them to you.

    * <file-name#> is the *full* filename, ie. including the PATH!

		* FSP SERVERS

   You need to have the FSP client software installed on your system.
If you don't know what FSP, clients, or software is, better choose a
different service; or read the FSP FAQ, and/or alt.comp.fsp.
