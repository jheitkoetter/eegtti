	* WHERE'S A WORLD-WIDE WEB TEST-DRIVE INSTALLATION?

   For a test drive, point your favorite Worl Wide Web client to URL:
"http://www.Germany.EU.net/books/bdgtti/bdgtti.html" therein you'll
find some maps that contain the other W3 sites around the globe. This
Guide is the most read on a global scale!

			-=- * -=-

	* WHAT ABOUT UPDATES?

   The Guide has been publish by MIT Press as *Everybody's Guide to the
Internet" in July 1994. Adam Gaffin continues to update the book on a

in group alt.internet.services and comp.org.eff.talk.

delivered to you. Email subscription works by sending a message body of

	* SO, WHATZ THE PROBLEM? (with apologies to Douglas Adams)

   There are of course many problems connected with young ape-descended life
forms, of which some of the most popular are `What is life all about?'
`Will I ever be able really to understand young ape-descended life forms
of the oppopsite sex?' And `What is EFF's (Extended) Guide to the Internet?'

   The Encyclopedia Galactica defines the "EFF's Guide to the Internet"
as a mostly interesting attempt by the EFF to bring knowledge to the people.
The marketing division of Sirius Cybernectics Corporation defines "EFF's
Guide to the Internet" as `Your Electronic Online Pal Who's Fun To
Be With.'  The Texinfo editor of "EFF's (Extended) Guide to the Internet"
defines it as `The Best Stuff I've Been Involved In Since Breakfast.'

   Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopedia Galactica that had the
good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future
defined the "EFF's Guide to the Internet" as a mostly interesting but
useless attempt by the EFF to bring knowledge to the people...?

	* WHO WROTE IT?

   This Guide, originally written by Adam Gaffin, then a senior news reporter,
of Middlesex News, Boston, MA, comes in an easily understood language, and
provides almost all information you'll ever need to survive, when you got
stranded in this mindboggling universe called Internet, ie. the Net of all
Nets on this crazy planet. So take this writing as kind of electronic
Babelfish, that helps you to understand what the hell everybody out there
is talking about.

			-=- * -=-

	* WILL I BE ABLE TO READ IT?

   The Guide is available (in one format at least) for all currently running
computer architectures, from Amiga to CRAY, although some IBM EBCDIC main-
frames might have problems with the ASCII versions. But usually you won't
work with these anyway. (And thus won't have to worry what EBCDIC is all
about...) It comes in printable (TeX DVI, PostScript, ASCII) and
electronically readable formats (World-Wide Web/HTML, GNU Info). You will
definitely be able to read one version at least!

			-=- * -=-

	* WHERE DO I FIND The Guide?

   The Guide actually *is* wide-spread, globally speaking; distribution site
locations range from KOREA to JAPAN to AUSTRALIA to USA to CANADA to the
UNITED KINGDOM to GERMANY to SWITZERLAND to AUSTRIA to BETELGEUZE to SOUTH
AFRICA to RUSSIA. Only LATIN AMERICA is missing at present. So what about
the Southern hemisphere, folks? Where are you, Netizens? (The complete list
is appended below.)

			-=- * -=-

	* HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE?

   If you find any mistakes/typos/inaccuracies/whatever in this posting
drop me a mail; if you have newer informatio than the ones listed
below drop me a mail; if you have questions, please folks, *READ THE GUIDE
FIRST*, it's all in there.

Given you're a system/ftp/WWW administrator: Please consider installation of
The Guide on your site; and please let me know. The more sites carry The Guide,
the sooner these postings will go away... ;-)

Anyway, enjoy the trip!

Ciao,	-joke
