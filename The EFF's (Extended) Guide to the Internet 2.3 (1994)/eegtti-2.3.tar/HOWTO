NOTICE
    * If you don't know how to uncompress gzip'ed files (.gz), or any
    other howevercompressed files, just don't tell FTPmail the suffix!
    FTPmail and Squirrel are clever enough to *automatically* uncompress
    the file(s) split them, and mail them to you.

    * <file-name#> is the *full* filename, ie. including the PATH!
