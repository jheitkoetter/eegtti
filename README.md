EFF's (Extended) Guide to the Internet (Last edited: Sept 1994)

This is the full texinfo source to one of the guides written to get everyone in the early 90ies
jacked nto the Internet. It was freely distributed between 1993 and 1994.
Originally this guide was published as Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet in the E-mail newsletter
EFFector Online by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Note that due to the unintentional naming clash with the trademark owner of the "FOR DUMMIES" guides,
we had to rename the guide multiple times. Thus multiple Online versions emerged from this original
ASCII text source, including this guide, which is still archived at the EFF:

Adam Gaffin who worked on behalf of he EFF and the Apple Library at the time, published his guide with
Mitch Kapor as paperback "Everybody's Guide to the Internet"
http://www.amazon.com/Everybodys-Guide-Internet-Adam-Gaffin/dp/0262571056

I publish the full texinfo sources for historical purposes only.

Have fun, -joke
